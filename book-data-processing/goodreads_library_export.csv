As we follow Hans Castorp we are introduced to situations and characters that resemble a Studio Ghibiri film and ideas that must've been widely discussed during the intellectual ferment that precipitated the Great War.  Given Mann's revision of the novel following the catastrophe, we can witness Mann's critique of the hubris that pervaded Europe's intellectual elite and educated middle class. It reminds one of Hesse in his condemnation of the 'bourgeoisie' but in Mann's sense it feels more like a pointed attack on how self indulgent intellectual babble can be meaningless and pernicious enough to condemn millions of men to their death.  Whenever Mann paints an image of the sanatorium and its zanny character's, it invokes a surrealism, a strange blend of reality and dreamscape; time feels distorted, the weather defies seasonal convention, people behave strangely in public and no one bats an eye. There are times when the novel carries on, Mann seems to enjoy verbosity and it is hard not to feel like he's doing it for humours sake.  But I enjoyed it.  It's funny when someone describes at length a year as being a complicated arrangement of the earth orbiting the sun.  The final chapter tied everything together.  In contrasting the brutality of WWI with our bashful  'good engineer' and his playful residence, one can appreciate the tragedy of idealism crushed by reality. How the self-assured, overconfident middle class and their abstract ideas on politics, society and philosophy could cause a militarism that resulted in unprecedented violence.  Perhaps there is a moral in The Magic Mountain that is relevant to our times.  As a newbie to German literary classics, this book makes me want to dig deeper into the canon, I loved it.",,,1,0

It felt like I'd met a kindred spirit, as I was reminded on the frustrating experience of going through university and having to read academic papers (from the sciences and humanities) that were written poorly and seemed to be self congratulatory on how complicated their subject matter was.  Pinker does a good job in substantiating the perspective that the world has improved much more than people think, but it at times feels a little one sided as we are shown a slew of graphs and stats that only assist his argument.  The last three chapters were my favourite.  Pinkers commentary on the intellectual left and populist right are clear and insightful and he gives us reason to believe in the merit of ideas and values that materialised in the enlightenment.  He also gives a refreshing perspective on opposing the trite romanticism that attempts to overthrow reason and constructive progress by appealing to emotion and calling on the 'dire need' for the human spirit to over throw the shackles of modernity.  I've definitely fallen prey to this way of thinking, attracted to the self righteous, artificial profundity bereft of originality which only really stirs the brewing shitpot of passionate, illogical opinion. That being said, Pinker is not some  science-will-fix-all rationalist that curb stomps the arts, he celebrates painters, writers and celebrates the human spirit as a humanist.  This is why I think he is a brilliant thinker, he can write well, provides a balanced argument and gives good reason to believe that our belief systems inherited from the enlightenment are (and continue to be) worth keeping.",,,1,0

We encounter ridiculous situations where spoiled artists have allowed praise to drive their ego to disportionate sizes.  As usual the novel follows real events and people that have been masked with pseudonyms, so part of the joy is uncovering the faces and discovering how creative celebrities acted terribly at vain West Coast parties.  I guess, Bukowski fans would say this novel lacks his typical fire, grit, desperation and rage but I think it was nice to read a novel that didn't wallow in misery and misfortune.  He seems to have reached an age or level of comfort that enabled him to relax, and it's reflected in his writing. Overall, a fun book, something to kick back and relax to whilst nursing a hangover on a Sunday.",,,1,0

Its interesting to see reflections of this critique in other writers like Orwell, Chatwin and Lawrence, inviting wonder on the timeless effects of civilisation on humankind.  This book gets pretty gnarly towards the end as our protagonist begins to enter into some abstract realms with strange characters.  Overall I liked Hesse's self reflection and hypocrisy in Haller, but got a bit bored with the sections of prolonged dialogue and romantic tropes.

He probably wrote Ham on Rye when he reached and age that removed him from his bitter rage that pervades his other novels.  It's filled with cynical wit and a perspective of how Bukowski was an outsider since early childhood.   My first bildungsroman that I actually enjoyed, it was a good time.",,,1,0

I would read the book, put it down and get the feeling that a thin layer of grease had covered me head to toe.  I can understand it's appeal and reverence through the years but I found it difficult to settle into the prose and tangential conversation.

It's clear he sympathises with the working class and disdains upper class hubris.  It was useful having background on the time period from reading Orwell's Road to Wigan Pier and Hommage to Catalonia.  Both Lawrence and Orwell share similar perspectives on the pernicious impacts of industrialisation,  consumerist society and the consequential demise of romanticism and celebration of the human spirit.  The period is a pretty fascinating one as it seemed that the old aristocracy were on their last legs, recognising (albeit reluctantly) their irrelevance in a society that was growing to recognise modern ideas of social mobility and egalitarianism.  The characters felt a bit one dimensional, each one having a strong point of view, never really questioning their own perspectives.  The novel is a sucker for romantics, with a lot of romantic literary techniques used by Shelley, Eliot and what not.  Overall, I liked Lawrence's criticism on social injustice and entrenched class norms in modern England but found myself eye rolling at the shallow characters and cliche romantic narrative. I appreciated the provocative language and (for its time) unconventional focus on a woman's sexual desires and sexual fulfilment.",,,1,0
